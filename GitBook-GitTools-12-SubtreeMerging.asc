Subtree merging is an alterate strategy
to solve the nested project problem
that submodules already solve.

Git has several merge strategies. One is
the subtree merge.

recursive::
- can only handle merging two branches
- is more aggressive with auto-merges

octopus::
- can handle more than two branches;
- is more conservative with auto-merges

subtree::
* appropriate for subprojects
* the situation has two projects A & B
* one maps to a subdirectory of the other
* _and vice versa_
** projectA/projectB
** projectB/projectA
* with a subtree merge, git will auto-merge
