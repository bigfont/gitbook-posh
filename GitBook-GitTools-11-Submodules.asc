# Submodules

- Use one or more projects from within another project,
- while keeping the commits seperate. E.g.
** use and contrib to a third partly library
** develop a project that's shared among parents
- Treat parent and child as separate repos,
- while also using them together.

[NOTE]
=====
Submodules help us to avoid code entanglement.

# Starting with Submodules (1 hr)

- main project and sub projects

-----
git submodule add <uri> [dir-name]
git diff submoduleDir
git diff --submodule
-----
- add a submodule to an existing repo
- the submodule dir will have the repo name
- submodule mapping goes into `.gitmodules`
** stores <url> directory mappings
** is version controlled like other files
** has a line for each submodule
** for a public project, use a public url
- git only tracks a submodule when we're in its dir
- from the parent, git tracks it as a dir
** not as a subdir
** nor as a file

# Cloning a Project with Submodules (0.5 hrs)

-----
# clone parent, register submodules, pull submodule
git clone <parent-repo-url>
git submodule init # register submodules
git submodule update # pull down submodule files

# do it all at once
git clone --recursive <parent-repo-url>
-----

- When we clone a repo with submodules,
- we receive empty submodule dirs.
- Populate with `submodule init; submodule update`.
