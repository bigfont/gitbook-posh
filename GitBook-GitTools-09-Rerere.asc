# Rerere

- merge, resolve the conflict, unmerge, and then reuse the resolution later
- reuse recorded resolution

## Scenario One, many mini merges before big merge

- you have a long lived topic branch
- regularly merge, resolve conflicts, and back out merge
- then when it's time for the big merge, use rerere

## Scenario Two, merge many branches together

- you have many topic branches that must integrate
- merge them all together, and resolve conflicts
- if tests don't pass, back out all the merges
- then remerge without the breaking branch
- run rerere to resolve conflicts

[Note]
=====
The above two strategies can also work with rebase.
