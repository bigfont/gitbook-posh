# How do we install Git on Windows?

The following is how to use Chocolatey to install Git for use with PowerShell.

.Install chocolaty
[PowerShell]
----
Invoke-Expression (curl 'https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')
----

.Install MsysGit
[PowerShell,Chocolatey]
----
choco install git
----

Msysgit includes:

. **Git SCM** (this is Git for Windows)
. **Git Bash** (emulation of Git in Linux)
. **Git GUI** (a basic GUI)
. **Shell Integration** (right click integration)

.Install PoshGit

Now we're ready to use Git.

# How do we create a local repo?

.Everything is local
[NOTE]
=====
Git is a distributed version control system.
A local repo has everything that a remote one has.
=====

.Initiate a local Git repository
[PowerShell,Git]
----
cd ~\Documents
ni -t d GitDemo
cd GitDemo
ni -t d Repo1
git init
----

The \GitDemo\Repo1 directory is now a Git repo.

# What's the most basic Git workflow?

. Make changes to files in the working directory
. Stage those changes with `git add`
. Commit those changes with `git commit`
. Repeat
. Check Git status throughout with `git status`

.git add
[NOTE]
====
* In Git, we *add* a file to the *index*.
The index is also called the *staging area*.
The staging area is a list of all the files
that are going to be part of the next commit.
* Working Dir > Index > Repo

.The most basic Git workflow
[PowerShell,Git]
-----
# create a file and check status
ni -t f file1.txt
git status

# stage the file and check status
git add file1.txt
git status

# commit the file
git commit -m "Add file1.txt"

# add some content to the file; check status
ac file1.txt "Some content"
git status

# stage the file; commit
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Add content to file1.txt"

# How do we communicate with a remote repo?

Okay, we have a local repository.
We have made several commits.
Now we want to share our work with others.

Git calls other repositories *remotes*,
although these can be anywhere. Let's
setup another local repo as our first remote.
Later we will setup a remote on GitHub.
